/*
 * Text shift. 把一段话从 horizontal 的形式输出称为 vertical 形式
 * Given a horizontal array of strings convert it to vertical. Like English characters are read left to right. 
 * Convert them to Chinese format which is read vertically. 
 * Ex. Epic is a healthcare Company.
 * Interviewing for software developer.
 * Print this vertically sentence by sentence.
