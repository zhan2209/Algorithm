## 809. Expressive Words
```
Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling, such as "hello" -> "heeellooo", "hi" -> "hiiii".  In these strings like "heeellooo", we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same:  "h", "eee", "ll", "ooo".

For some given string S, a query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to S by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the group is 3 or more.

For example, starting with "hello", we could do an extension on the group "o" to get "hellooo", but we cannot get "helloo" since the group "oo" has size less than 3.  Also, we could do another extension like "ll" -> "lllll" to get "helllllooo".  If S = "helllllooo", then the query word "hello" would be stretchy because of these two extension operations: query = "hello" -> "hellooo" -> "helllllooo" = S.

Given a list of query words, return the number of words that are stretchy. 

 

Example:
Input: 
S = "heeellooo"
words = ["hello", "hi", "helo"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can extend "e" and "o" in the word "hello" to get "heeellooo".
We can't extend "helo" to get "heeellooo" because the group "ll" is not size 3 or more.
```

## Food for thought
```
这道题主要是如何判断两个字符是否能够通过复制得到。

第一步，遍历数组，得到每一个char的出现次数，存储在HashMap中
比如S = "heeellooo"处理后是hashmap = {{‘h’, 1}, {‘e’, 3}, {‘l’, 2}, {‘o’, 3}}。

第二步：对words的每一个字符串进行匹配

第三步：扩张+匹配

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int expressiveWords(String S, String[] words) {
        if (words.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (String w : words) {
            if (this.canExpand(S, w)) {
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    private boolean canExpand(String S, String W) {
        if (W.length() == S.length()) {
            return S.equals(W);
        }
        int sLen = S.length();
        int wLen = W.length();

        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < sLen && j < wLen) {
            char s = S.charAt(i);
            char w = W.charAt(j);
            if (s != w) {
                return false;
            }
            int x = 1, y = 1;
            while (++i < sLen && S.charAt(i) == s) {
                x++;
            }
            while (++j < wLen && W.charAt(j) == w) {
                y++;
            }
            if (x < y) {
                return false;
            } else if (x > y) {
                if (x == 2) {
                    if (y == 1) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return i == sLen && j == wLen;
    }
}
